# Simple Genetic Algorithm for path-finding problem

I used the basic concept of GA to minimize the distance in pathfinding problems. Here are some results showing how the average 
distance and minimum distance changed with each generation. I used 90% crossover and 10% mutation throughout the evolution 
process. The distance values I used in this example are between 0 to 100, and 50% nodes are connected. 
The Genetic Algorithm path finding is a part of the path planner that also uses Dijkstra, A*, AGA, etc
